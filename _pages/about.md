## Briefly about me
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD candidate in Civil - Structural - Engineering and a research assistant at Civil Infrastructure Technologies for Resillience and Safety (CITRS) labs at University of Central Florida (UCF).

📖 My research explores novel solutions to challenging problems in operation, maintenance, and management of civil engineering structures by employing **Generative Artificial Intelligence**, **Virtual Reality**, and **Robotics**, coupled with **Structural Health Monitoring** techniques.

🎯 My research aims to enhance the condition assessment procedures of civil engineering structures to improve their overall safety for the betterment of our life quality.

👨‍🏫 During my PhD, I was a teaching assistant of undergraduate level Engineering Statics course and also assisted in teaching graduate level courses, such as Finite Element Analysis and Dynamic Analaysis of Structures at UCF.

👷 During my master and bachelor programs in Civil (Structural) Engineering, I had the opportunity to work in the residential (skyscrapers) and infrastructure (bridge & airports) constructions as well as residential structural engineering design firms.

🌐 I'm also a member of ASCE-SEI, the Chair of the ASCE-SEI Grad Student Chapter at the University of Central Florida, and have served in ASCE-SEI Graduate Student Chapters as chair, vice chair, and public secretary roles.

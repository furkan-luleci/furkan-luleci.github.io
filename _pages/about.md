👨🏻‍💻 I am a PhD candidate in Civil - Structural - Engineering and a research assistant at Civil Infrastructure Technologies for Resillience and Safety (CITRS) labs at University of Central Florida (UCF).

📖 My research explores novel solutions to challenging problems in operation, maintenance, and management of civil engineering structures by employing **generative Artificial Intelligence**, **Virtual Reality**, and **Robotics**, coupled with **Structural Health Monitoring** techniques.

🎯 My research aims to enhance the condition assessment procedures of civil engineering structures to improve their overall safety for the betterment of society life quality.

👨‍🏫 I also assisted in teaching undergraduate level Engineering Statics and gaduate level courses, such as Finite Element Analysis and Dynamics of Structures at UCF.

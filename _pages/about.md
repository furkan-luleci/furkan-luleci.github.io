## Briefly about me
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD candidate in Civil - Structural - Engineering and a research assistant at [Civil Infrastructure Technologies for Resiliency and Safety (CITRS)](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/citrs/) labs at the [University of Central Florida (UCF)](https://www.ucf.edu/). My PhD advisor is Professor [F. Necati Catbas](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/catbas/), who is Lockheed Martin St. Laurent Professor and the director of CITRS.

📖 My research explores novel solutions to challenging problems in the operation, maintenance, and management of civil engineering structures by employing **Generative Artificial Intelligence**, **Virtual Reality**, and **Robotics**, coupled with **Structural Health Monitoring** techniques.

🎯 My research aims to enhance the condition assessment procedures of civil engineering structures to improve their overall safety for the betterment of our life quality.

👨‍🏫 During my PhD, I was a teaching assistant for a undergraduate level Engineering Statics course and also assisted in teaching graduate level courses, such as Finite Element Analysis and Dynamic Analysis of Structures at UCF.

👷 During my master's and bachelor's programs in Civil (Structural) Engineering, I had the opportunity to work in residential (skyscrapers) and infrastructure (bridge & airports) constructions as well as residential structural engineering design firms.

🌐 I'm also a member of ASCE-SEI, the Chair of the [ASCE-SEI Grad Student Chapter at the University of Central Florida](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sei-ucf/?viewAsMember=true), and have served in [ASCE-SEI Graduate Student Chapter Leadership Council](https://www.asce.org/communities/institutes-and-technical-groups/structural-engineering-institute/local-chapters) as chair, vice chair, and public secretary roles.

### Research Interests
Structural Health Monitoring, Generative Artificial Intelligence (especially large generative models using adversarial-based models, diffusion models and/or transformers), Virtual Reality systems, Robotics (unmanned ground vehicles), Structural Dynamics, Non-Destructive Testing & Evaluation, Numeric Modelling & Analysis, Modal Analysis, Bridge Load Rating, Smart Cities, Structural Reliability, Resilience, Sustainability, System Diagnostics & Prognostics.

### Near Future Goals
- Develop a multi-robot-based structural condition assessment system to support community and infrastructure resiliency and enhance their efficiency in operation, maintenance, and management.
- Characterize and develop a Generative Artificial Intelligence-based methodology to generate possible sensor data of various types of civil engineering structures for different structural conditions to optimize/minimize the data collection efforts from them.

### Lifetime Goals
- Convert near-future goals into a practical business model to contribute to society for the betterment of our life quality.
- Be a professor and become a great mentor for new generations.
- Write a novel.
- Maybe have a PhD in another field, like History or Archeology.
